/** System time ISR. 
GG Very complex macro dance
NIL_IRQ_HANDLER -> PORT_IRQ_HANDLER ->ISR
So declaration is like
ISR(PORT_IRQ_HANDLER)

Arduino wiring.c 
define a ISR(TIMER0_OVF_vect) (usage:???)
Also Tone.cpp could be configured to use Timer0 but it does not use it
/Applications/Arduino.app//Contents/Resources/Java/hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino/Tone.cpp:495


From http://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/Timers-Arduino


In the Arduino world timer0 is been used for the software Sketch timer functions, like 
__delay()__, __millis()__ and __micros()__. 
If you change timer0 registers, this may influence the Arduino timer function. 
So you should know what you are doing.

Pins
Arduino Uno
>>> Pins 5 and 6: controlled by timer0 <<<
 PWN on this PINS FAILS (?)

Arduino Mega
Pins 4 and 13: controlled by timer0

And about music:
tone() function uses at least timer2. Y
ou canâ€™t use PWM on Pin 3,11 when you use the tone() function an Arduino and Pin 9,10 on Arduino Mega.
